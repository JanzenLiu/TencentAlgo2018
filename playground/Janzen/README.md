## TODO
- [ ] Try TensorFlow
- [ ] Try PyTorch
- [ ] Try MXNet
- [ ] Try FM
- [ ] Try FFM
- [ ] Try PNN (Polynominal Neural Networks)
- [ ] Try matrix decomposition (MF, SVD/SVD++, etc.)
- [ ] Try sklearn FeatureUnion and Pipeline
- [ ] Try tuning hyperparameters with hyperopt
- [ ] Try stacking
- [ ] Try ensemble with raw features involved (my idea)
- [ ] Try cython
- [ ] Implement (or just copy from somewhere) Bayesian smoothing for CTR/CVR
- [ ] Implement simple A/B test
- [ ] Implement a full tunable and testable pipeline (it's fine to be simple, but it must be complete)
